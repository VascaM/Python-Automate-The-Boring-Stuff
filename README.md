# Python Automate the boring stuff

I'm currently in the process of learning Python through the 'Automate the Boring Stuff' book and its corresponding Udemy course. I've been diligently working through the material and practicing my skills by completing various exercises and projects. I've included some of the code snippets I've written up to this point and plan to update this page with even more examples. As I continue to progress, I'm eagerly anticipating tackling more complex topics and taking on increasingly challenging projects.
